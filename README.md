# DiscordOverwatchBot

This is a simple discord bot for viewing stats from Overwatch. It uses the offitial Overwatch API to get the stats. I use an npm package called [Overwatch-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/overwatch-api) to get the stats.

The bot is based on one of my other bots, you can find it [here](https://github.com/BakxY/DiscordApexBotJS).

## Run it yourself

We will create an guide on how to run the bot yourself. If you have any questions you can contact me on discord(BREXIT#2164) or just create an issue in the repo.

## I found a issue

If you find a bug or have an idea, please create an issue. We will look into it as soon as possible.
